# Kartik Verma — Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio:  
👉 **https://krtk-vrm.github.io**

The site is built as a clean, modern space that reflects my interests in algorithms, systems, and the early foundations of quantitative development.  
It stays intentionally lightweight — fast to load, smooth to use, and minimal by design.
